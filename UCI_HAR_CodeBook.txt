 		CODE BOOK - Data Dictionary for UCI_HAR_TidyData.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file UCI_HAR_TidyData.txt contains the average (per 30 persons and 6 activities) 
of 66 measures from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description of the original data set is available at the site: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file UCI_HAR_TidyData.txt has 68 columns

The first column "subject" identify which of the 30 volunteers was being studied.
The second column "activity" identify which activity the subject was doing when the measurements were taken.

Columns 3 through 68 represent the Mean and Standard Deviation values of 33 signals:

tBodyAcc[XYZ]
tGravityAcc[XYZ]
tBodyAccJerk[XYZ]
tBodyGyro[XYZ]
tBodyGyroJerk[XYZ]
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc[XYZ]
fBodyAccJerk[XYZ]
fBodyGyro[XYZ]
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Mean is the abbreviation for maen value.
Std is the abbreviation for Standard Deviation value.

'[XYZ]' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
Prefix 't' denotes time domain signals.
Prefix 'f' denotes frequency domain signals as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed on the signals.
Acc is the abbreviation for accelerometer.
Gyro is the abbreviation for gyroscope.
Jerk - The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.
Mag - The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
