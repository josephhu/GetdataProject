 		CODE BOOK - Data Dictionary for UCI_HAR_TidyData.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file UCI_HAR_TidyData.txt contains the average (per 30 persons and 6 activities) 
of 66 measures from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description of the original data set is available at the site: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file UCI_HAR_TidyData.txt has 68 columns

The first column "subject" identify which of the 30 volunteers was being studied.
The second column "activity" identify which activity the subject was doing when the measurements were taken.

Columns 3 through 68 represents the mean "-mean()" and standard deviation "-std()" of 33 signals:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
Prefix 't' denotes time domain signals.
Prefix 'f' denotes frequency domain signals as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) were performed on the signals.
Acc is the abbreviation for accelerometer.
Gyro is the abbreviation for gyroscope.
Jerk - The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.
Mag - The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
